This is the current iteration of my personal website. This is the first in a series of experiments to
replace my legacy WordPress site with something a bit more... modern. As such, I elected to build this
project using entirely new (to me) technologies, including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), 
[React](https://reactjs.org), and [Static Site Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_site_generators).
