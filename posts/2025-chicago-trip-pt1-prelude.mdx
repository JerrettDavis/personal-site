At the beginning of February 2025, I was sent just outside Chicago to Itasca, IL for the IFS NA US FY2025 kickoff. 
After spending the previous three years working entirely remotely, the chance to finally meet my colleagues in
person was deeply rewarding and reinvigorating. I gained fresh insight into the projects everyone else was working on,
and the social interactions sparked a much-needed creative recharge.  

At the conclusion of the two-day kickoff, most folks either caught the first flights out or jumped in their cars to make
the drive home. I, however, took a day of PTO to wander downtown Chicago before my afternoon flight.  

On a brisk, windy February morning, I hitched a ride with one of the VPs of Sales and one of his salesmen, who were heading
off to schmooze a new potential client. Between their stories and a few of my own, I caught glimpses of the city through the
window of their rather plush Cadillac Escalade. We alternated between rocketing down the highway and creeping along at a
snail’s pace in rush-hour traffic. The combination wasn’t kind to me after indulging in perhaps one or two too many drinks
with the same VP the night before. The waves of nausea rose and fell with the traffic, but with luck on my side, I managed
to stave off full-blown carsickness for the duration of the ride.  

They dropped me at Millennium Park, where I was greeted by the polished, stainless-steel curves of Chicago’s Cloud Gate (or
*The Bean*, as it’s more affectionately called) and a cutting wind so sharp it briefly overrode my sense of awe at the
towering skyscrapers and the streams of racing cars, buses, and people.  

Once I regained my composure and bid my companions farewell, I climbed the steps toward the coruscant Bean. The wind, coming
at me from every possible direction, was the most unfriendly I’d yet endured—but despite my inadequate layers, I pressed on,
undaunted. At the top of the stairs, I found no one waiting—only a strangely nostalgic, shuttered Casa Bonita food stall and
an empty plaza devoid of any soul but my own.  

There it was: the infamous Bean, in all its glory. And for a brief moment, it was mine alone—an occasion I’ve since learned
is exceedingly rare.  

I snapped a few photos on my phone, fired off a couple Snapchat videos to friends and family, and then set off in search of
somewhere warm to regroup and chart my next move. I had two goals left before heading home:  
1. Get to the top of the tallest building I could reasonably manage.  
2. Make a pilgrimage to Micro Center—a supposed nerd mecca we tragically lack in the state of ~~depression~~ Oklahoma.  

The first goal was obvious. Chicago’s skyline is a forest of glass and steel, and it would have felt almost criminal to leave
without seeing it from above. The second goal? Well, let’s just say every techie I know speaks of Micro Center in tones
usually reserved for holy relics: rows of motherboards, bins of cables, obscure adapters you didn’t even know you needed—
paradise in fluorescent lighting.  

Just below the Bean sat a handful of other (closed) shops, a (closed) ice-skating rink, and—thankfully—some open restrooms.
After a bit of freshening up and thawing out, I mapped out my route to Willis Tower, about a mile away. On the map I noticed
the Chicago Cultural Center along the way and decided to make it my first stop.  

After a short, frigid 500-foot walk, I stepped into its ornate interior—marble staircases, vaulted ceilings, and stained glass
that felt more like a civic cathedral than a public building. A helpful receptionist greeted me warmly, offering a quick
orientation of the space, some neighborhood context, and tips on current attractions. She pointed me toward several art
exhibits on display—a fortunate discovery, since I had managed to pick the one day the Art Institute of Chicago was closed.  

I can’t recall every detail of the pieces I saw, but I do remember the striking diversity: sculptures, paintings, and
multimedia installations in a wide range of materials and styles. Nearly every floor and room held something different,
making it feel less like a single gallery and more like a patchwork of Chicago’s creative voices. The historic Tiffany Dome
was partially shrouded in scaffolding for renovations, but even through the work it was dazzling—its thousands of pieces of
stained glass catching the winter light like a frozen kaleidoscope. I didn’t have the time to fully linger, but even in that
brief window the place left an impression.  

Once I had gotten my fill of culture—and regained a suitable amount of feeling in my face and fingers—I headed back out into
the concrete jungle. I tried glancing upward to spot the Willis Tower, but it was like standing on the forest floor trying to
guess which tree was tallest. Fortunately, Google Maps’ compass proved far more reliable than my neck. I bundled up as best I
could, grabbed my luggage, and set off once more across downtown Chicago.

Though Willis Tower was only about eight blocks away, I quickly discovered how challenging it is to navigate while dodging
pedestrians, fumbling with a touchscreen through gloves, and keeping your head on a swivel. Thankfully, downtown Chicago
offers a steady stream of storefronts and lobbies to duck into every few feet—perfect for recalibrating directions and
defrosting fingers. After stopping an embarrassing number of times to confirm I was still heading the right way, I finally
arrived at a surprisingly understated black-glass-and-steel entryway.  

I craned my neck skyward to reassure myself this was, in fact, the Willis Tower. Aside from a cluster of four aquarium-like
glass pods clinging near the roofline, it looked much like many of its titanic brethren looming over downtown. Just to be
absolutely sure, I stepped inside and asked the entry guard, “This is the Willis Tower, right?” He smiled and confirmed that
it was.  

“And this is where I can go up top and see the city?” I pressed. Another pleasant affirmation: “Yep! Take the stairs to my
right and follow the signs.” And with that, dear reader, we were in. My impromptu Chicago tour had reached its next stop.  

A short set of signs and a slightly confusing tangle of escalators led me to a bank of terminals where I purchased my ticket
for the Skydeck. Thirty-two dollars later, I was hoping this elevator ride would prove life-changing—in the awe-inspiring
sense, not in the US healthcare sense.

After a quick detour through the gift shop (where I grabbed souvenirs to cram into my IFS-branded insulated cooler bag won
from some long-forgotten teambuilding exercise), I made my way to the start of the tour. First up was airport-style security:
X-raying my overstuffed carry-ons, getting wanded, and pulling off my hat to show off my haircut—or at least, that’s what I
told myself the reason was. Once through “T-S-B,” I was herded in front of a branded backdrop where a photographer snapped a
shot clearly destined to be sold back to me at the exit.  

Security and paparazzi complete, I was funneled into the self-paced Skydeck Museum Tour. This walk-through exhibit presented
a crash course in Chicago history with a distinctly social-media aesthetic, inviting photo ops at nearly every turn. It
started with the city’s origins, moved through the Great Chicago Fire, and highlighted the rebirth of its architecture and
infrastructure. Displays included a full-scale replica of an “L” train car, a “Taste of Chicago” corner with a mirror-tricked
giant pizza slice, and a nine-foot-long hot dog bench begging for selfies.  

There was even a walk-through comedy set practically daring you to make bad airline food jokes. Beyond that were a series of
photo-ready exhibits placing you alongside famous Chicagoans—think the Obamas and Oprah—as well as scaled landmarks that
made you feel like you’d wandered into a theme park version of the city.  

I’m sure there were more details I’ve since forgotten, but suffice it to say the Skydeck museum was an adventure in its own
right—before I’d even stepped into an elevator. Speaking of which, that’s exactly what awaited me at the end of the tour:
two unassuming elevator doors and a smiling attendant stationed to press the button. They did so promptly as I arrived.  

After a short wait, I was greeted by the soft *ding* of my ride and ushered into a car of my own. Over the next ninety
seconds or so, the elevator’s interior screens played a rapid-fire video about Chicago and the tower’s history, synced to
the sensation of the floor numbers racing ever higher. My ears popped again and again as the city fell away beneath me.  
It was a strange little liminal space—part thrill ride, part history lesson, part pressure chamber.

When the doors opened, I was first met by a blank black wall and a set of stanchions meant to guide non-existent queues of
visitors on and off the elevators. But then, just to my left, the scene opened into brightness: vast, cool walls of windows
on the 103rd floor drinking in unbroken sunlight. All around was a sweep of glorious blue sky. As if drawn by a magnet, I
walked straight from the elevator to the glass, my eyes scanning the southern horizon.  

What spread out before me was a panorama of industry and humanity. I saw a sprawling train depot, ribbons of water snaking
through the city, and block after block of activity—millions of lives in motion, all within my view. The sheer scale of it
was humbling, and for a moment I stood still, simply trying to take it in.  

Shifting eastward, the view opened onto Lake Michigan. Its deep blue surface stretched to the horizon, porcelain-still and
ocean-like in its vastness. Compared to what I usually see back in Oklahoma, it might as well have been the sea. There were
few boats cutting across its waters, but not none—some still daring enough to brave the frigid winter chill.  

Between the lake and myself rose clusters of skyscrapers in varying heights, a sweeping green expanse of parks, and a neatly
laid-out marina that was almost architectural in its symmetry. After some searching, I finally spotted Millennium Park below—
the very place where my day in downtown Chicago had begun.

Pivoting northward, I continued to absorb the immense urban sprawl. As far as my eye could see, anything not lake seemed to
be of human origin in some fashion. I snapped a few selfies before a helpful stranger offered to take some proper shots. I
happily accepted, striking poses for our impromptu photo session. After a flurry of clicks, he returned my phone, we traded
pleasantries, and parted ways.  

At last, I was ready for the grand finale: the Skydeck itself. The attraction consisted of four aquarium-like pods—five walls
of clear glass jutting four or five feet out into empty air above the city. After breezing through the non-existent line, I
was handed my very own “fish tank.” Once again I shed my backpack, cooler, and winter layers, then stepped inside.  

I entered with the grace of someone whose limbs had instantly been replaced with slightly al dente spaghetti. The glass box
was oddly disorienting, and vertigo set in almost immediately, forcing me to steady myself with a hand against the wall. After
a few seconds to gather my composure, an attendant cheerfully directed me to pose for yet another souvenir photo.

Once the scripted photo was out of the way, the pod was mine. Officially, visitors are given ninety seconds to take their
own shots, but the policy allows you to hop back in line for another turn—or, if there’s no line at all, linger as long as
you’d like. With the place practically empty, I took full advantage, snapping away from every imaginable angle before finally
preparing to part ways.  

Re-equipped for my trek, I headed back to the elevators for the descent into the bowels of the Willis Tower. I braced myself
for the inevitable sales pitch, but the ride down was pleasant—accompanied by another short video thanking me for visiting
and inviting me back.  

At the end of the breakneck descent came the expected gauntlet of salespeople eager to part me from a few of my hard-earned
dollars in exchange for hat-hair-laden photos. Time—and perhaps the lingering haze of ethanol—has blurred the exact pricing,
but somewhere between $35 and $60 would get you a package of prints already waiting for you. Out of respect for the wasted
paper and ink, I dutifully handed over the cash. Those photos now rest, fittingly enough, in the depths of my tool chest.  

Photos stashed, I navigated back down the maze of escalators to the street-level lobby where I had first entered. I paused
there to summon an Uber to Micro Center, located outside of downtown. After a short wait, my driver arrived. We exchanged
pleasantries and quickly discovered we were both software engineers, which made for easy conversation. We touched on the
local market, speculated about Micro Center’s inventory during ongoing electronics shortages, and otherwise made small talk
on the way.  

From the outside, Micro Center was underwhelming, its exterior hardly telegraphing what lay within. But the moment I stepped
through the doors, my tune changed. To my right was the tech support and PC building counter, followed by rows of PC cases.
Beyond that stretched aisle after aisle of densely packed shelves filled with every technical product I could imagine—all at
prices that seemed almost too good to be true, consistently undercutting Amazon, Best Buy, and the rest by a healthy margin.  

There were 3D printers and filament, Raspberry Pis, graphics cards (though no 40xx or 50xx series at the time), processors,
cameras, TVs, VR rigs, entire aisles devoted to mechanical keyboards, and so much more. I had truly found the best tech
retailer I’d ever stumbled across—and this was coming from someone who had spent nearly five years working at Best Buy.

Unfortunately, with limited space to stash electronics—and an already extensive setup waiting at home—I restrained myself
to just one practical purchase: a pre-charged battery bank to get my phone through the flight and landing.  

One quick, pleasant checkout later, I called yet another Uber and headed for the airport. This drive was longer, quieter,
and more contemplative as I nursed my fatigue, reflected on the past few days (both corporate and personal), and finally allowed
myself to relax after an intensive four-day social marathon.  

Somewhere in the blur of airports and flights that followed, I made a promise to myself: I’d be back in Chicago for a more
in-depth visit.  

And now here I am, writing this after fulfilling that commitment. The second trip—this time with my wife and kid—was even
more packed, more fun, and far more meaningful. We traced some of my February steps, discovered plenty of new ones, and had
a genuinely wonderful time.  

This prelude has turned into a story of its own, but it sets the stage. In **Part 2**, I’ll dive into our full week as a
family in Chicago—the places we explored, the memories we made, and why it was the perfect bridge between closing one
chapter of my career and beginning the next.
