In early February, I flew to Itasca, Illinois—just outside Chicago—for the IFS North America US FY2025 kickoff. 
After three years of working fully remote, finally meeting colleagues face-to-face was a much-needed reset. It 
reminded me what it’s like to collaborate with people in actual rooms—not just across video calls and message threads. 
The sessions were energizing, the conversations full of new momentum, and the social side of things (including some 
post-conference drinks) helped reconnect a few rusty interpersonal circuits.

Once the two-day event wrapped and most folks headed straight home, I opted to take advantage of the timing. My 
return flight wasn’t until late afternoon, so I used a PTO day to explore downtown Chicago. A few hours of wandering 
alone felt like the perfect way to recharge after several tightly packed days.


## A Cold Morning and a Solo Moment with the Bean
That morning, I caught a ride into the city with a VP and one of his team, who were headed downtown for a client 
meeting. Between bursts of traffic and conversation, I tried to keep queasiness at bay—being a car passenger has 
never been my strong suit. Eventually, they dropped me off near Millennium Park, where the wind wasted no time 
reminding me that Chicago in February is not for the faint of heart.

There, at the top of a quiet plaza, stood one of the city’s most iconic sights: Cloud Gate—better known as The Bean 
from its shape. Designed by British-Indian artist Anish Kapoor, up close it feels almost otherworldly. Made from 
polished stainless steel plates seamlessly welded together, its mirrored surface looks flawless, reflecting the 
surrounding skyline, pedestrians, and sky in surreal, fluid distortions.

To my surprise, the space around it was completely empty. For a few quiet minutes, I had the whole sculpture to 
myself—a rarity in any season. I snapped a few photos, sent off a couple of Snapchats, and took a moment to simply 
stand there and take it in. The icy wind made it hard to linger, but the moment still sticks with me.

## Warming Up and Making a Plan
After my fingers started going numb, I ducked into a nearby restroom to regroup and thaw out. With a few hours still 
to go before my flight, I gave myself two goals:
- See Chicago from as high up as reasonably possible.
- Visit Micro Center—a destination revered by people in technical fields, and one we tragically don’t have back home in Oklahoma.

For the uninitiated, Micro Center is more than just a computer store like Best Buy. It’s a rare kind of brick-and-mortar 
haven where you can still walk in, talk to someone knowledgeable, and find everything from the latest processors to 
obscure cables, microcontrollers, and 3D printer filament—often at prices that beat even the internet. For those of 
us who build, code, or just tinker, it’s a kind of practical paradise.

But first: I needed to find the tallest building in reach. According to my map, Willis Tower was about a mile away. 
But just along the route, I noticed another spot I’d never visited: the Chicago Cultural Center. A quick detour there 
seemed like the perfect warm-up – literally.

The moment I stepped inside, I knew I’d made the right choice. The Cultural Center was striking, with ornate marble
staircases, towering ceilings, and details that made the building feel more like a cathedral than a public space. A
friendly woman at the reception desk offered a quick orientation, pointing me toward a handful of current exhibits and
kindly informing me that, yes, I had in fact managed to pick the one day the Art Institute of Chicago was closed.

The exhibits were a wide mix—sculptures, photography, mixed media—all tucked into a patchwork of rooms and wings. It 
felt less like a curated gallery and more like a living expression of the city’s creative pulse. 

The famous Tiffany Dome, partially covered for renovation, still managed to be awe-inspiring: thousands of pieces of 
stained glass arranged in a vast mosaic overhead, capturing and scattering the winter light like something sacred.

I didn’t stay long—I was still on a mission, after all—but the center was the kind of accidental discovery that gives 
a solo city walk its magic.

## Navigating the City, Vertically
Back out in the cold, I bundled up, slung my bag over my shoulder, and started the walk to Willis Tower. In theory, 
it was just a straight shot—a mile, give or take. In practice, downtown Chicago in February isn’t exactly built for 
smooth solo navigation. Between the wind tunnels, crowds, an unfamiliar (to me)  downtown, and the touchscreen-gloves 
battle, I had to stop more than once to recalibrate in a lobby or storefront.

Eventually, I found myself standing at the base of a stark black-glass facade, unassuming for a building once known as 
the tallest in the world. I craned my neck skyward and spotted the telltale glass boxes near the top—confirmation that 
yes, this was the place.

A security guard inside confirmed it for me: this was the Willis Tower, and yes, the Skydeck was open. I followed the 
signs up a level and bought my ticket. After winding through a short maze of escalators and a surprisingly efficient 
security check (complete with souvenir photo op), I entered the beginning of the Skydeck Experience.

Before you even reach the elevator, the tour leads you through a kind of visual history of Chicago—an immersive, 
high-gloss walk through its architecture, industry, and cultural touchpoints. There were playful displays built for 
interaction: a life-sized “L” train car, a photo-ready hot dog bench, and an oversized slice of deep-dish pizza 
positioned for maximum visual impact. Everything was polished, brightly lit, and angled just so. Even the timelines 
and trivia felt designed to entertain as much as inform.

It wasn’t subtle, but it was fun. And beneath the Instagram bait, there were real moments of insight about how the 
city had grown and reinvented itself again and again.

Eventually, I reached the elevators. A smiling attendant pressed the button, and seconds later, I was inside and 
ascending—alone in the car, surrounded by screens playing a slick montage of Chicago’s skyline and history. Floor 
numbers ticked upward faster than my ears could adjust.

When the doors opened onto the 103rd floor, I stepped into sunlight.

The room opened up around me in every direction. Floor-to-ceiling windows revealed the city stretching endlessly 
below: ribbons of train tracks, avenues of glass and concrete, the lake beyond, still and enormous, like a painted 
backdrop. From that height, the human scale of things disappears. What’s left is geometry and movement—trains like 
veins, cars like glints of light, every street laid out in sharp detail.

To the east, Lake Michigan looked like an ocean: deep blue, wide, and motionless. I scanned the water for boats and 
eventually found a few, small and stubborn against the cold. I kept turning, taking in more: parks, marinas, more 
towers, more sky. Down below, I spotted Millennium Park—the tiny silver arc of The Bean glinting in the sun—where 
the day had started.

## Stepping Into Thin Air
Then came the ledges: four glass-floored boxes jutting out from the side of the building, offering the chance to 
step—visually, at least—into thin air above the city. When my turn came, I hesitated for a breath, then walked in.

Vertigo arrived almost instantly. Something in your brain resists trusting a surface that looks like the open sky. 
I reached out instinctively, steadying myself with a hand on the side wall and willing my feet to behave like I wasn’t 
standing 1,300 feet above the pavement with only 1.5” of glass to separate us.

After a quick souvenir photo by the staff, the pod was mine. In peak season, with crowds cycling through nonstop, 
each party typically gets around 90 seconds before they’re shuffled back out. But on that quiet February afternoon, 
there was no one waiting. No line. No pressure. So I lingered.

I took a few photos—some serious, some silly—then finally just stood there, letting the moment settle. The silence, 
the height, the stillness of the lake off to the east—it all felt impossibly far from the bustling winter streets 
below. It was a rare sort of stillness in a place designed to move people through quickly. And for that little while, 
the ledge was mine.

Eventually, I stepped back, collected my bag, and made my way toward the elevator for the long ride back down.

## A Tech Pilgrimage
Back at ground level, I passed through the usual post-attraction gauntlet: souvenir stands, escalators, and one last 
attempt to sell me a photo of myself mid-squint, 103 stories up. I gave in—maybe out of politeness, or maybe some 
part of me wanted proof I’d actually done it. 

Outside, I caught an Uber heading northwest away from the towers, toward something less scenic but just as 
anticipated: Micro Center.

My driver turned out to be a fellow software engineer, which made for easy conversation. We traded stories about the 
local market and speculated about what might be in stock, laughing at how far out of the way we’d both go just to 
browse in person.

From the outside, Micro Center looked unassuming—a squat, gray box nestled in a shopping center between two 
discount stores. But stepping inside was like entering a different world: shelves lined with graphics cards, 
processors, Raspberry Pis, and obscure cables no big-box store bothers to stock. Dedicated aisles for mechanical 
keyboards and thermal paste. In a time when so much tech shopping happens online, there’s something satisfying—almost 
grounding—about walking through rows of physical inventory and knowing it’s all right there, ready to be held, 
compared, and bought.

I took my time, soaking it all in. Though I could have easily blown my budget in one visit, I restrained myself to a 
single practical purchase: a battery bank to keep my phone charged through the flight home.

My Uber ride to the airport was quieter—no tech talk, no small talk, just the soft glow of streetlights flickering 
past as I finally let the weight of the week settle. The work kickoff had been intense professionally and socially, 
especially after years of working from home. I’d crammed a lot into four days with work events, let alone an 
afternoon to check out one of the largest cities in the U.S.

And yet, what stuck with me most wasn’t any meeting or skyline photo, but that quiet moment of stillness at The Bean,
the unexpected art in the Cultural Center, and the hush of a nearly empty Skydeck.

Somewhere between the TSA sweep and takeoff, I made myself a promise to come back. Not just for a day. Not in transit. 
But for a proper visit.

And I did.

That return trip—with my wife and kid alongside—was everything I’d hoped for. We retraced a few February footsteps, 
discovered new ones, and built lasting memories.

But that’s a story for Part 2.
